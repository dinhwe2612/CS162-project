# CS162-project

This is the Course Management System, a project made by Group 05 for the CS162 - Introduction to Computer Science II course of the Advanced Program in Computer Science (APCS) of the University of Science - Ho Chi Minh city (HCMUS).

The project focuses on the manipulation of dynamic data structures, as well as text files and directories. The project also helps familiarize students majoring in computer-related fields with collaborative workflows and models, namely git and github (or gitlab, gitbucket, etc).

The product is designed with usability and simplicity in vision, therefore offers a graphical user interface for familiarity and ease of use. However, due to the inexperience, the interface design may not be highly efficient in terms of egonomics, space usage, components position and aesthetic, despite the effort going into polishing the user experience. We believe that our approach will suit the workflow of most computer-literate users, but that is not to say this practice is superior to the command line interface approach.

The program functions are designed to be self-explained and offer some flexibility in usage, however the user still needs to follow a set of rules for a smooth and bug-free experience. Popular desktop environments (Windows, Mac OS, Linux) are supported, however it is recommended that the user runs the program on Windows for maximum compatibility.

Technology used: C++, CMake, Raylib.
